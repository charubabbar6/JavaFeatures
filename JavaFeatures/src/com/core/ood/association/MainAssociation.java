//association is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that describes 
//a relationship between two classes. It signifies how objects of one class interact or 
//are connected with objects of another class. Association helps in modeling the real-world 
//relationships between entities in a program.
//Aggregation vs. Composition: Both are types of associations:
public class MainAssociation {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}
//HAS-A relationship

//Aggrgation is a weak association(loose coupling) one object can live without another object
//e.g. car and driver /team and football player
//composition is a strong association(tight coupling) one object can't live without another object 
//e.g. Engine can't exist without car'
