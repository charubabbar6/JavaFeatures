Java8 Inteface Changes:
1. Static Method:
Static methods in interfaces are useful for defining utility functions related to the 
interface that do not depend on instance-specific data. Unlike default methods, which 
provide a default implementation for methods that can be overridden by implementing classes, 
static methods in interfaces are not inherited by implementing classes.

Key Characteristics of Static Methods in Interfaces
Class-Level Scope: Static methods in an interface are called using the interface name, 
not through an instance of a class that implements the interface.

No Inheritance: Static methods in interfaces are not inherited by implementing classes. 
They must be called using the interface name.

Purpose: Static methods in interfaces are typically used for utility functions related 
to the interface or for providing default implementations of some common functionality.

*******************************************
2. default method:
This feature enables you to add new methods to interfaces while maintaining backward compatibility 
with existing implementations. Default methods help to avoid the issue of "interface evolution," 
where adding new methods to an interface would otherwise require updating all implementing classes.

Key Points About Default Methods
Syntax: Default methods are defined in interfaces using the default keyword. They provide a method 
body within the interface itself.

Purpose: Default methods allow you to add new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing
 implementations. This is particularly useful in large codebases or libraries.

Overriding: Classes that implement the interface can override the default method if they need a 
specific implementation.

Multiple Inheritance: If a class implements multiple interfaces that contain default methods 
with the same signature, the class must override the method to resolve the ambiguity.


#####################################
Static Methods:

Belong to the interface itself.
Must be called using the interface name.
Not inherited by implementing classes.


Default Methods:

Provide default behavior that can be inherited by implementing classes.
Can be overridden by implementing classes.
Can access instance members of the class implementing the interface.

***************************

##why do we need static methods in interface?

1. Interface static method helps us in providing security by not allowing
 implementation classes to override them.
 2. interface static methods are good for providing utility methods,
 for example:null checking i.e. whose definition will never change.
