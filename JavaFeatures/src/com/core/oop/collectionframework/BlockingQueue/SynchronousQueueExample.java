//The SynchronousQueue is a special kind of BlockingQueue that does not store elements. Instead, each put() operation must wait for a corresponding take() operation by another thread, and vice versa. This means that a SynchronousQueue acts as a direct handoff mechanism between producer and consumer threads.
//No Internal Storage: It doesnâ€™t hold any elements internally.
//Blocking Operations: The put() method blocks until a consumer thread takes the element, and the take() method blocks until a producer thread puts an element.
//Useful for Hand-off Scenarios: Ideal for situations where tasks are passed directly from producers to consumers without intermediate storage.
