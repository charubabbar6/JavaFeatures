//Fail fast iterators throws concurrent modifiaction exception when one thread is iterating over collection object and 
//other thread structurly modify collection either by adding,removing or modifying objects on underlying collection. They are 
//called fail fast  because they try to immediatly throw exception when they encounter failure.
//
//Fail-fast iterators are designed to detect concurrent modifications to a collection (e.g., structure changes like 
//adding or removing elements) during iteration. If such a modification is detected, they throw a 
//ConcurrentModificationException.
//
//Behavior:
//
//Detection: They immediately throw an exception if the collection is modified while iterating.
//Consistency: Ensures that the iteration reflects the state of the collection at the time the iterator was created.
//Performance: Fail-fast iterators typically offer better performance because they donâ€™t need additional 
//synchronization mechanisms.
